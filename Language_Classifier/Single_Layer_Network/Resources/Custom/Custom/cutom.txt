Self-introduction – for careerSelf-introduction during  an interview is  a crucial  one in  any networking  situation. It is both a personal and professional communication skill that is needed in your everyday life. Think about how you can use this short period of time to not only introduce yourself but  also convey something about who you are and what you do. When you introduce yourself, it is not for anyone else's benefit but YOURS!   In  brief, self-introduction is marketing your skills. First impressions count a great deal in an interview. A job interview is a tough competition with one or a few winners. And the manner in  which you introduce yourself in an interview will be remembered so much so that it might be  the deal breaker.
